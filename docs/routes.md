# Flight Desktop Rest API - Routes

Manage interactive VNC sessions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) \[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\] \[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All errors conform to the [JSON:API error specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#errors).

## Headers and Authorization

All requests SHOULD set the following headers:

```
# All Routes
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json

# NON GET Routes
Content-Type: application/json
```

The `Authorization` header SHOULD be an `Bearer` token issued by an appropriate authentication service. It MAY alternative use a `cookie` given by the `sso_cookie_name` configuration. The following SHALL be returned if the token can not be verified:

```
HTTP/2 401 Unauthorized
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "401",
      "code": "Unauthorized"
    }
  ]
}
```

Commands can not be executed as `root` to mitigate against security issues. The following error will be raised when attempting to preform any action as `root`:

```
HTTP/2 403 Forbidden
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "403",
      "code": "Root Forbidden"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `POST` request also needs to specify the `Content-Type` otherwise the following error will be raised:

```
HTTP/2 415 Unsupported Media Type
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "errors": [{
    "status": "415",
    "code": "Unsupported Media Type"
  }]
}
```

## Configs

### GET Show

Returns the default configuration for the user.

```
GET /configs/user
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "id": "user",
  "desktop": <desktop-type>,
  "geometry": <geometry>
}
```

### PATCH Update

Update the configuration.

``
PATCH /configs/user
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
Accepts: application/json
{
  "desktop": [new-desktop-type],
  "geometry": [new-geometry]
}

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "id": "user",
  "desktop": <desktop-type>,
  "geometry": <geometry>
}
```

## Sessions

### ID

The `id` for a `sessions` MUST conform to the `UUID` format according to [RFC4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-3).

*BUG NOTICE:* There is a known issue where the first "portion" of the UUID can be used as an `id`. Its behaviour is undetermined and SHALL be removed in future releases. The full UUID MUST always be used as the `id`.

### GET Index

Return a list of all currently running desktop sessions for the identified user. The `data` attribute MAY be empty. The `include=screenshot` query parameter SHOULD trigger the base64 encoded screenshot to be returned for each session resource.

```
GET /sessions
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "data": [
    <session-resource-object>,
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Other Responses

To retrieve the screenshot for each session:

```
GET /sessions?include=screenshot
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "data": [
    <session-resource-object-with-screenshot>,
    ...
  ]
}
```

### GET Show

Returns an instance of a running session. The `include=screenshot` query parameter SHOULD trigger the base64 encoded screenshot to be returned with the request.

```

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "id": "<UUID>",
  "desktop": "<desktop-type>",

  "state": "<Active|BROKEN|...>",
  "created_at": "<None|time-rfc339>",
  "last_accessed_at": "<None|time-rfc3339>"
}

# When the screenshot is included

GET /sessions/:id?include=screenshot
Authorization: Bearer <token>

HTTP/2 200 OK

#### Other Responses

```
HTTP/2 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "404",
      "code": "Not Found",
      "detail": "Could not find 'session': <missing-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST Create

Start a new vnc session with the given `desktop` type.

*BUG NOTICE*: The `port` and `state` MAY not be returned by the request due to internal limitations. The `port`/`state` SHOULD be determined using a standard `GET Show` request.

```
POST /sessions
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "desktop": <desktop>
}

HTTP/2 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
{ <session-resource-object> }
```

#### Other Responses

Not all of the `desktop` types are available which is most likely due to missing dependencies. The application will do its best to "prepare" a desktop without installing any additional dependencies. The following error will be raised if the `destkop` is still not available:

```
HTTP/2 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "400",
      "code": "Desktop Not Prepared"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following error SHALL be returned if the `desktop` is missing.

```
HTTP/2 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "404",
      "code": "Not Found",
      "detail": "Could not find 'desktop': <missing-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### DELETE Terminate

Will attempt to kill an actively running session and permanently remove its configurations. The `strategy` attribute is OPTIONAL and will default to `kill`. The `clean` strategy will only attempt to remove broken sessions.

```
DELETE /sessions/:id`
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json
{
  "strategy": "<kill|clean>"
}

HTTP/2 204 No Content
```

### Other Responses

The request SHALL return `204 No Content` after it has successfully cleaned a broken session. Actively running session can not be cleaned and SHALL respond with `400 Bad Request`.
```
DELETE /sessions/:id`
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: application/json
{
  "strategy": "clean"
}

HTTP/2 204 No Content

HTTP/2 400 Bad Request
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "400",
      "code": "Bad Request",
      "detail": "unsupported strategy: <strategy>"
    }
  ]
}
```


### GET Screenshot

Retrieve the screenshot associated with a session as `image/png`. This route can be directly embedded into a `src` tag.

```
GET /sessions/:id/screenshot.png
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accepts: image/png

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: image/png
... Image ...
```
